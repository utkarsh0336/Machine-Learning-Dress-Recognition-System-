# Machine-Learning-Dress-Recognition-System-

It is Machine Learning Model that recognises Dress Pattern given as input image to the model.
It is developed using CNN method that has more than 90% accuracy.
It has been developed during an Machine Learning Intership Program at Intrainz where I was taught the basics of the ML Algos and then will be given this Project.
The Internship was in Online Mode.
